smart agri rover (krishi saarthi) is a mobile, iot-powered farming solution that helps farmers monitor and manage their fields more efficiently through real-time data collection and intelligent analysis. the rover is equipped with humidity, temperature, soil moisture, and air quality sensors along with a precision camera to capture visual data, enabling a comprehensive understanding of field conditions. as it moves autonomously across different parts of the farm, it collects localized data, which is sent to a cloud platform (blynk iot, firebase, or aws iot) for processing. farmers receive actionable insights through a mobile or web dashboard, helping them optimize irrigation, predict environmental changes, and manage resources more effectively. built using cost-effective hardware like arduino, esp8266, and esp32-cam, krishi saarthi is scalable across various farm sizes, adaptable to different crop types and terrains, and designed to make precision farming accessible even to small-scale farmers. by bridging the gap between traditional agriculture and modern technology, it empowers farmers to boost yields, reduce resource wastage, and achieve greater sustainability.
